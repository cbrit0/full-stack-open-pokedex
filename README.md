# Part 11: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

This repository contains my submission for **Part 11** of the **Full Stack Open** course imparted by the **University of Helsinki**. Part 11 focuses on **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**, which are essential practices in modern software development for automating the build, test, and deployment processes.

## Course Content Overview

Topics covered include setting up CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions**, automating testing and deployment workflows, and integrating these practices into a full-stack application. The goal is to create a seamless process where code changes are automatically tested and deployed, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.

## Commands

Start by running `npm install` inside the project folder

`npm start` to run the webpack dev server
`npm test` to run tests
`npm run eslint` to run eslint
`npm run build` to make a production build
`npm run start-prod` to run your production build

## Deployment
The application is deployed using the CI/CD pipeline configured in this repository. You can access the live application at:
