# Exercise 11.1: Warming up

In a Ruby-based application, a CI pipeline typically includes linting, testing, and dependency management. For linting, **RuboCop** is a popular tool that enforces code style and identifies issues. Testing is often handled by **RSpec**, a powerful framework for writing expressive tests, or **Minitest**, a lightweight alternative bundled with Ruby. Since Ruby is an interpreted language, thereâ€™s no traditional build step, but **Bundler** is essential for managing dependencies and ensuring consistency across environments.

Beyond Jenkins and GitHub Actions, several CI tools are well-suited for Ruby projects. **GitLab CI/CD** integrates seamlessly with GitLab repositories and offers robust CI/CD features. **CircleCI** is another strong contender, known for its ease of use and excellent Ruby support. **Travis CI**, once a favorite in the Ruby community, remains an option, though its popularity has waned in recent years.

Choosing between a self-hosted or cloud-based CI environment depends on factors like budget, team size, and security needs. A self-hosted setup, such as Jenkins on a private server, provides greater control and customization but requires more maintenance and infrastructure management. Cloud-based solutions like GitHub Actions or CircleCI are easier to set up, scale, and maintain, making them ideal for smaller teams or projects with limited resources. For a team of six working on an actively developed application, a cloud-based CI setup is likely more efficient and cost-effective, allowing the team to focus on development rather than infrastructure.
